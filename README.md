# DotNetCore2.WebJob.TemplateProject
A dotnet core 2.1 webjob template

This is a dotnet core console app that will publish as an Azure WebJob.

It's a stripped-down version from a personal project that I used with service, data and domain project layers to operate in the Azure. It will act as a base template for creating your own WebJobs, and includes a telemetry service template for pushing insights.

I'll post details of the automated build and release cycle to an Azure App Service to my blog.
